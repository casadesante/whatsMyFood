Personal food review tracking made easy.

We chance upon various restaurants in which some dishes are great, whilst some are terrible, and itâ€™s hard to remember all of them. When we revisit those restaurants, WMF will happily help you recall those good and terrible dishes.

### Setting up React native:
1. Please follow the instructions [here](/doc/reactNative/setup.md) to set up React Native.
2. Create the `.env` file in root directory of the project with the requird keys

### Contributing:
This repo uses [Commitzen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) to make the commits more readable and understandable. **cz-conventional-changelog** commitzen adapter is added at the root's `package.json`.

Install commitzen globally by running `npm install commitizen -g`.

Install commitzen's plugin named emoji-cz by running `npm install emoji-cz -g`

#### Commit workflow:

- Add your files using `git add` or `git add .`
- Commit by running `npm run commit`
- Answer the questions and it will automatically commit
- Now, push the commits to remote. 

### Serverless setup:
- Check into **serverless** by running `cd serverless/functions`.
- Run `npm i -g firebase-tools` to deploy firebase functions.
- Set required **environment variables** by running
```js
firebase functions:config:set telegram.groupid="<TELEGRAM-GROUPID>"
firebase functions:config:set telegram.token="<TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN>"
``` 
- Check **Telegram Bot** section for any help with telegram environment variable information.
- After changing the source code in `serverless/functions/index.js`, CD `whatsMyFood/serverless/functions` and run `firebase deploy --only functions`.

### Telegram Bot
- Get the **TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN** from **TelegramBotFather** account in telegram.
- To get the telegram **groupID**, hit the following URL:
`https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM-BOT-TOKEN>/getUpdates`
- Look for the value of `chat.id`.

### Cron Job
We need to send a weekly report of users, restuarnts & foods added to our database. This requires cron feature in firebase functions. This is not supported for the moment. So, we have used [cron-jon](https://cronless.com), an external resource to invoke the respective functions which sends a weekly report to telegram group.
